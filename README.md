# Web Dev Basics for RestfulAPI debugging

Following is a self-learn module with 24-lesson curriculum which is all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

## Pedagogy

>To be able to troublshoot issues related to RestAPI and other script related issues, it is important to understand the basics before we jump into [![ClientAPI Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dynamics%20365-0B53CE.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Dynamics-365&logoColor=white)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference)


Chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a typing game, a virtual terrarium, a 'green' browser extension, a 'space invaders' type game, and a business-type banking app, and will have also learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer.

Purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: "[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)".

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://ashy-river-0debb7803.1.azurestaticapps.net/), for 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.
